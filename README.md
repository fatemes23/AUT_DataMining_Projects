# AUT Data Mining Projects

This repository contains various data mining projects completed as part of my coursework. Below are the details of each project:

## Project 4: Frequent Pattern Mining
In this project, we implemented algorithms such as Apriori and Eclat to find frequent patterns in the Retail dataset. The goal was to identify common sets of items that are frequently purchased together.

## Project 5: Classification
This project focuses on classification techniques, where we applied different machine learning algorithms to classify data .

## Project 6: Clustering
In this project, we explored clustering methods to group similar data points together. 

## Project 7: Outlier Detection
This project involved detecting outliers in the data.
